# Stride Game Engine embedding in .NET 8 Windows Forms, WPF and AvaloniaUI

This repo is a work in progress about how to embed the Stride Game Engine in a .NET 8 Windows Forms, WPF and AvaloniaUI application.
The goal is to have a single Stride game engine instance running in a .NET 8 Windows Forms, WPF and AvaloniaUI application.

Initial WinForms project was copied from [StrideGameNet5WinFormsDemo](https://github.com/windperson/-StrideGameNet5WinFormsDemo), and adapted to .NET 8.

WPF StrideView is based on this [gist](https://gist.github.com/EricEzaM/5797be1f4b28f15e9be53287a02d3d67)

AvaloniaUI is yet to be implemented.
